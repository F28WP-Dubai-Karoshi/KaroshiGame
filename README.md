# KaroshiGame

Play as a virus and get the highest score of each round. Eat food(pellets) to increase your score and beat others by shooting at them, but make sure to avoid the sanitizer and the masks! 

Points are gained:
- By eating pellets
- By successfully killing other players 

Points are lost:
- By colliding with sanitizer and mask
- By shooting other players, this makes the player cautious of shooting randomly

Health is lost:
- When getting shot by the players 
- When colliding with sanitizer and mask


Each round lasts 5 minutes and the top 10 players (those with the highest number of points) are displayed on a scoreboard. 

Virus types (Players choose their virus):

Blue Virus:  Faster than the others, but loses double the points when hitting a mask/sanitizer.

Red virus: Natural hunter, gains more points when it kills other viruses, but half points when eating food. 

Green virus: Strongest one, loses least points when hitting a mask/sanitizer but moves slower than the others.

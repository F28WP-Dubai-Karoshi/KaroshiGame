# KaroshiGame

Play as a virus and get the highest score of each round. Eat food and grow in size to beat others, but make sure to avoid the sanitizer and the masks! 
Points are earned on eating food and killing opponents.

Each round lasts 5 minutes and the top 10 players are displayed on a scoreboard. 

Virus types: (Unsure?)

Blue Virus:  Faster than the others, but loses double the points when hitting a mask/sanitizer.

Red virus: Natural hunter, gain more points when eating other viruses, half points when eating food. 

Green virus: Strongest one, loses least points when hitting a mask/sanitizer but moves slower.

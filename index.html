        Play as a virus and get the highest score of each round. 
            
        Each round lasts 5 minutes and the top 10 players (those with the highest number of points) are displayed on a scoreboard.   
            
        How to play: 
        Eat food (pellets) to increase your score and beat others by shooting at them, but make sure to avoid the sanitizer and the masks! 


        Points are gained:
        - By eating pellets
        - By successfully killing other players 
            
        Points are lost:
        - By colliding with sanitizer and mask
        - By shooting other players, this makes the player cautious of shooting randomly
            
        Health is lost:
        - When getting shot by the players 
        - When colliding with sanitizer and mask
            
            
        Virus types (Players choose their virus):
            
        Blue Virus:  Faster than the others, but loses double the points when hitting a mask/sanitizer.
            
        Red virus: Natural hunter, gains more points when it kills other viruses, but half points when eating food. 
            
        Green virus: Strongest one, loses least points when hitting a mask/sanitizer but moves slower than the others.
